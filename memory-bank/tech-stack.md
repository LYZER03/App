## 7. Technology Justifications

### 7.1 Why Next.js over alternatives?
Next.js was chosen for its hybrid rendering capabilities, which are crucial for an e-commerce platform that needs both SEO benefits and interactive features. The App Router provides a modern approach to routing with nested layouts, loading states, and error boundaries, which simplifies the development of complex UI flows like the checkout process.

### 7.2 Why PostgreSQL over NoSQL options?
PostgreSQL offers the relational structure necessary for e-commerce data with complex relationships between users, orders, products, and categories. Its ACID compliance ensures data integrity for critical operations like payments and inventory management, while still offering JSON capabilities for flexible data when needed.

### 7.3 Why NestJS for the backend?
NestJS provides a structured architecture that scales well with team size and application complexity. Its module system encourages separation of concerns and reusability, while its built-in support for TypeScript ensures consistency between frontend and backend type definitions.

### 7.4 Why Prisma over other ORMs?
Prisma offers a superior developer experience with its intuitive schema definition language and type-safe client. The automatic migrations streamline database schema evolution, and the generated TypeScript types ensure consistency between the database and application code.

### 7.5 Why Shadcn UI over component libraries?
Shadcn UI provides high-quality, accessible components without the bundle size impact of full component libraries. Its source-code-first approach allows for complete customization while maintaining consistency and reducing development time.
