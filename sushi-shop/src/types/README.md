# TypeScript Types

This directory contains TypeScript type definitions used throughout the application.

Examples:
- Product types
- User and authentication types
- API request/response types
- Form data types
- Redux state types

Note: Per best practices, we prefer explicit types over interfaces and use type guards where appropriate.
